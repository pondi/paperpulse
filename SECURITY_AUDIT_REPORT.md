# Security Audit Report - PaperPulse v1.0.0

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted on the PaperPulse application to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities, with a focus on multi-tenancy isolation, Laravel Octane compatibility, and general security best practices.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Multi-tenancy Security Issues

#### HIGH SEVERITY: Missing User Scoping in Models

The following models lack proper user scoping, potentially exposing data across users:

- **File.php**: No global scope for user_id filtering
- **Receipt.php**: No global scope for user_id filtering  
- **Category.php**: No global scope for user_id filtering
- **LineItem.php**: Can be accessed without user filtering through Receipt relationship

#### HIGH SEVERITY: Controller Authorization Issues

1. **ReceiptController::byMerchant()** (lines 136-173)
   - Does not filter receipts by authenticated user
   - Could expose receipts from other users
   
2. **ReceiptController::show()** (lines 71-102)
   - No verification that receipt belongs to authenticated user
   - Direct model binding without user check

3. **MerchantController::index()** (lines 21-69)
   - Aggregates data from all users' receipts
   - No user-specific filtering applied

### 2. Shared Resource Concerns

The following models are currently shared across all users:
- **Merchant**: No user_id field, shared globally
- **Vendor**: No user_id field, shared globally
- **Logo**: No user isolation

This design decision needs review - should these be isolated per user or remain shared?

### 3. Missing Authorization Policies

No Laravel authorization policies found for critical models:
- Receipt
- File
- Category
- PulseDavFile

### 4. Route Protection

All routes appear to have auth middleware, but lack additional authorization checks.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Implement Global Scopes for User Isolation**
   ```php
   // Create app/Traits/BelongsToUser.php
   trait BelongsToUser {
       protected static function bootBelongsToUser() {
           static::addGlobalScope('user', function ($query) {
               if (auth()->check()) {
                   $query->where('user_id', auth()->id());
               }
           });
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Authorization Policies**
   - Create policies for Receipt, File, Category models
   - Implement viewAny, view, create, update, delete methods
   - Register policies in AuthServiceProvider

3. **Fix Controller Methods**
   - Add user filtering to ReceiptController::byMerchant()
   - Add ownership check to ReceiptController::show()
   - Update MerchantController to show user-specific data only

4. **Implement Route Model Binding Scoping**
   ```php
   // In RouteServiceProvider
   Route::bind('receipt', function ($value) {
       return Receipt::where('user_id', auth()->id())->findOrFail($value);
   });
   ```

### Medium Priority

1. **Review Shared Resource Strategy**
   - Decide on merchant/vendor isolation strategy
   - Consider hybrid approach with user_merchant pivot table

2. **Add Request Validation**
   - Ensure all user inputs are properly validated
   - Check for mass assignment vulnerabilities

3. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Already implemented for file uploads
   - Extend to other sensitive endpoints

### Low Priority

1. **Add Activity Logging**
   - Log sensitive operations (deletes, exports)
   - Implement audit trail for compliance

2. **Review Error Messages**
   - Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive information
   - Implement consistent error handling

## Laravel Octane Compatibility

### Current Issues

1. **No singleton abuse detected**
2. **No static property issues found**
3. **Cache keys need user context** - Some cache keys don't include user_id

### Recommendations

1. Update cache keys to include user context:
   ```php
   Cache::remember("user.{$userId}.receipts.{$key}", ...);
   ```

2. Review service providers for request data storage
3. Ensure proper cleanup in long-running jobs

## Next Steps

1. Create and apply BelongsToUser trait to affected models
2. Implement authorization policies
3. Fix identified controller methods
4. Review and update cache key patterns
5. Conduct penetration testing after fixes

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR: Ensure proper data isolation and deletion capabilities
- PCI DSS: If handling payment data, ensure proper scoping
- SOC 2: Implement audit logging and access controls
