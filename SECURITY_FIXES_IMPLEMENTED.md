# Security Fixes Implemented

## Date: January 2025

## Summary of Security Enhancements

### 1. Multi-tenancy User Isolation

#### Created BelongsToUser Trait
- Location: `app/Traits/BelongsToUser.php`
- Automatically filters queries by authenticated user
- Auto-sets user_id on model creation
- Provides scopeForUser() and scopeWithoutUserScope() methods

#### Applied BelongsToUser Trait to Models
- `app/Models/File.php` - Now scoped by user
- `app/Models/Receipt.php` - Now scoped by user  
- `app/Models/Category.php` - Now scoped by user

### 2. Authorization Policies

#### Created Authorization Policies
- `app/Policies/ReceiptPolicy.php` - Controls access to receipts
- `app/Policies/FilePolicy.php` - Controls access to files
- `app/Policies/CategoryPolicy.php` - Controls access to categories

#### Registered Policies
- Updated `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` to register all policies

### 3. Controller Security Fixes

#### ReceiptController
- Added `$this->authorize('view', $receipt)` to show() method
- Added `$this->authorize('delete', $receipt)` to destroy() method
- Added `$this->authorize('update', $receipt)` to update() method
- Added authorization to all line item methods
- Added authorization to showImage() and showPdf() methods
- Fixed byMerchant() to filter by user_id

#### MerchantController  
- Updated index() query to only show merchants with user's receipts
- Added user_id filter to receipts join

### 4. Remaining Security Tasks

The following items still need to be addressed:

1. **Frontend Security Review** (Task 48)
   - Verify Inertia props contain only current user's data
   - Check for sensitive data exposure in Vue components

2. **Laravel Octane Compatibility** (Task 49)
   - Review cache keys to include user context
   - Check for memory leaks in long-running processes

3. **Additional Security Measures** (Tasks 50-56)
   - Review all routes for proper middleware
   - Check API endpoint security
   - Audit third-party integrations
   - Implement security testing

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test multi-user scenarios to verify data isolation
2. Attempt to access other users' receipts via direct URLs
3. Verify merchant data only shows user-specific aggregations
4. Test all CRUD operations with authorization

## Notes

- Merchants and Vendors remain shared across users (by design)
- PulseDavFile model already had scopeForUser() implemented
- JobHistory model intentionally not scoped (system-wide tracking)
