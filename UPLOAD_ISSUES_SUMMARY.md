# File Upload Issues - Investigation Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Horizon Queue Configuration**
- **Issue**: Horizon was only configured to process the 'default' queue, but jobs were being dispatched to 'receipts' and 'documents' queues
- **Fix**: Updated `/config/horizon.php` to include all three queues:
  ```php
  'queue' => ['default', 'receipts', 'documents'],
  ```

### 2. **Meilisearch Configuration**
- **Issue**: File model was trying to index to Meilisearch without proper authentication, causing uploads to fail
- **Fix**: Temporarily disabled Scout indexing in `/app/Models/File.php` by commenting out `use Searchable;`
- **Long-term fix needed**: Configure MEILISEARCH_KEY in .env file

### 3. **Frontend Multiple File Handling**
- **Issue**: The form wasn't properly handling multiple files for upload
- **Fix**: Refactored `/resources/js/Pages/Documents/Upload.vue` to:
  - Create form dynamically in submit function
  - Use selectedFiles array directly instead of FileList
  - Properly track upload progress with reactive variables

### 4. **DocumentService Return Value**
- **Issue**: `DocumentService::processUpload()` was only returning boolean instead of full result array
- **Fix**: Changed return from `$result['success']` to `$result` to return complete upload information

### 5. **Error Handling and Logging**
- **Added**: Comprehensive logging in DocumentController to track file processing
- **Added**: Null check for uploaded files with proper error message

### 6. **User Authentication Check**
- **Issue**: DocumentService was defaulting to user ID 1 if not authenticated
- **Fix**: Added proper authentication check that throws exception if user not authenticated

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. **Meilisearch Configuration**
- Need to set `MEILISEARCH_KEY` in .env file
- Re-enable Scout indexing once configured
- Consider making Scout optional for development

### 2. **Redis Extension**
- PHP Redis extension not installed (using predis fallback)
- This may impact queue performance

### 3. **S3 Configuration**
- Verify AWS credentials are properly set
- Check if buckets exist and have proper permissions

## Testing Steps

1. **Start Horizon**: `php artisan horizon`
2. **Test single file upload**: Should work now
3. **Test multiple file upload**: Should process all files
4. **Check jobs**: Monitor in Horizon dashboard at `/horizon`

## Debug Tools Created

1. **Upload Debug Page**: `/documents/upload-debug` - Test native vs Inertia uploads
2. **Comprehensive logging**: Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for detailed upload information

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Configure Meilisearch properly or disable Scout for File model permanently
2. Install PHP Redis extension for better performance
3. Add integration tests for file upload functionality
4. Consider adding upload progress indicators for better UX
5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback for failed uploads
