Analyze this Norwegian receipt carefully and extract all relevant structured information:

<receipt_content>
{{ $content }}
</receipt_content>

@if(isset($extraction_focus))
Special focus on: {{ implode(', ', $extraction_focus) }}

Follow the JSON schema carefully but be flexible with missing information. If information is missing, leave fields empty or null rather than guessing.

## Important Guidelines:
1. Prices should be numeric values (not strings)
2. Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format (be flexible with date parsing)
3. Organization number as 9-digit string (optional if not present)
4. Quantities as decimal numbers
5. VAT rates as decimal numbers (0.25 for 25%, but allow approximations)

@if(isset($debug) && $debug)
Also include a 'debug' section with processing notes.
